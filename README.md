This graphic describes the population distribution accross the country using an overlay of two logarithmic models.

A linear fit was then used to describe the population overland, it illustrates that most of the population resides on the western part of the country and has a small outlier in the east.

Only using night time lights to descibe land use/ land cover yeilds this result.

![](Pop.Sums.png)

This map shows the sum of the population of Nicaragua distributed throughout the country, with most of the population being shown in the municiplaity of Managua

A Three-Dimensional plot of population sums was generated to show how much larger the density is in Managua versus other parts of the country. The large hole in the plot is a large lake.

## Administrative Subdivisions Comparison

### Population Density in Managua

### Population Density in Teustepe

Between the two plots, it is evident by the difference in their color scales that Managua has a much larger concentraion of people. Managua and Teustepe have similar land areas, the developement of the land however is much different. Managua is almost exlusively urbanized with a populatio of just over 1.2 million people; conversely Teustepe has a population of 36,000 people with only two vastly smaller 'urban' areas.
