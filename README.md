# Nicaragua

This is a spatial description of Nicaragua 


## Administrative Subdivisions of Nicaragua

This plot identifies all of the Departments of Nicaragua (adm1) and their subdivisions (adm2).

This plot highlights the subdivisions that will be explained further on this page.

## Population Density Throughout Nicaragua

![](nic.png)

Based on this graphic, it can be seen that most of the population of Nicaragua is concentrated in the western part of the country in the Department of Managua. Within Managua is the capital and has around 24% of the total population of the country.

This plot shows the centralized density of people within Managua.

This graphic describes the population distribution accross the country using an overlay of two logarithmic models.

A linear fit was then used to describe the population overland, it illustrates that most of the population resides on the western part of the country and has a small outlier in the east.

Only using night time lights to descibe land use/ land cover yeilds this result.

![](Pop.Sums.png)

This map shows the sum of the population of Nicaragua distributed throughout the country, with most of the population being shown in the municiplaity of Managua

A Three-Dimensional plot of population sums was generated to show how much larger the density is in Managua versus other parts of the country. The large hole in the plot is a large lake.

## Administrative Subdivisions Comparison

### Population Density in Managua

### Population Density in Teustepe

Between the two plots, it is evident by the difference in their color scales that Managua has a much larger concentration of people. Managua and Teustepe have similar land areas, the developement of the land however is much different. Managua is almost exclusively urbanized with a population of just over 1.2 million people; conversely Teustepe has a population of 36,000 people with only two vastly smaller 'urban' areas.

## Assessment of Healthcare, Transportation, and Human Developement

![](TeustepeGitHub.png)

As seen on in the image, there is one hospital that resides inside of the administrative boundary; the other is just outside in the next municipality which can be accessed by car. There are 463 km of roads within the municipality of Teustepe which link the minor urban areas via a primary road that runs through the center of the district.

| District | Urban Populations | Roadways | Healthcare Facilities |
| :--------: | :-----------------: | :--------: | :---------------------: |
| Teustepe | Largest Pop: 11,643 ppl | 463056.2 m of road | 2 Hospitals, 16,151 ppl/facility |

This 3D render illustrates how the topography of the region effected human development. The mountainous region forced persons to settle in the low-lying valley, where there is flatter ground. The settlements appear to be higher than the body of water in the lower edge to avoid flooding. The transportation network was also shaped by the valley; the one primary road runs along the basin of the valley linking two hubs of civilization in the area. There are a few tertiary roads that link the outlying population centers with the rest of the district. 
The lack of health care in the district can be inferred from there only being one hospital to support the entire population of 36,000. However, it can also be assumed that persons travel to the next district over to receive healthcare. With the main population of the country centered in Managua, I presume that the government does not maintain roads through the sparse regions of the country.
Human development in this area is definitely hindered by the lack of access to readily available care facilities. This region is dominated by agrarian communities that do not accumulate wealth. Much to the benefit of the disadvantaged, healthcare in Nicaragua is socialized, thus treatment is given at little to no cost to patients. This specific area in Nicaragua will most likely not progress past an agro-central economy thereby limiting development.
